# 🚀 Machine Learning Journey

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Repository**!  
This repo is a collection of my learning notes, Jupyter notebooks, and projects as I progress through various ML topics step by step.  

The goal is to **track my growth**, build a strong foundation in ML, and share useful resources with others learning the same path.
