# Bagging Learning Notebook  

This repository demonstrates **Bootstrap Aggregating (Bagging)** using Python and Scikit-Learn. Bagging improves model stability and accuracy by combining multiple learners trained on random subsets of data.  

## 📌 Contents  
1. Decision Tree Classifier – Baseline model.  
2. Bagging with Decision Trees.  
3. Bagging with SVM.  
4. Pasting.  
5. Random Subspaces.  
6. Random Patches.  
7. OOB Score.  
8. Bagging Tips.  

## ⚙️ Implementation Details  
- Dataset: Iris & Synthetic datasets.  
- Libraries: scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, mlxtend.  

## 🚀 How to Run  
  ```bash
  git clone <https://github.com/Vivekk-007/Ml/new/main/bagging-ensemble>
  cd <https://github.com/Vivekk-007/Ml/new/main/bagging-ensemble>
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  jupyter notebook bagging_demo.ipynb


## 📊 Results

Bagging improves accuracy compared to a single Decision Tree.

SVM with Bagging handles noisy data better.

OOB score helps validate without test split.
